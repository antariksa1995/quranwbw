## Prophet Musa in the Quran: A Comprehensive Exposition

The complete story of Prophet Musa (Moses) is extensively detailed throughout the Quran, offering profound insights into his life, mission, struggles, and ultimate triumph. The narrative spans multiple Surahs, weaving together key events, divine revelations, and pivotal interactions that shape the story of one of the most revered prophets in Islam.

**1. Musa's Birth and Early Life:**

The story begins with the Pharaoh of Egypt, who, fearing the Israelites' growing population and potential rebellion, decreed the killing of all newborn male Israelite children. This act of tyranny is the backdrop for the birth of Musa.

- **Quranic Verses:**

  - [Surah Al-Qasas:7] _"And We inspired to the mother of Moses, "Suckle him; but when you fear for him, then cast him into the river and do not fear and do not grieve. Indeed, We will return him to you and will make him [one] of the messengers."_
  - [Surah Ta-Ha:38-40] _"When We inspired to your mother what was to be inspired, [saying], 'Put him in the chest and cast it into the river, and the river will throw it onto the bank; [then] an enemy of Mine and an enemy of his will take him.' And I bestowed upon you love from Me that you would be brought up before My eye. [Recall] when your sister went and said, 'Shall I direct you to someone who will take care of him?' So We returned you to your mother that she might be comforted and not grieve. And you killed a man, and We saved you from distress and tried you with a [severe] trial. Then you remained [some] years among the people of Madyan. Then you came [here] at the decreed time, O Moses."_

- **The Mother's Instructions and the Basket:** Overwhelmed by the fear of the Pharaoh's decree, Allah revealed to Musa's mother to place him in a basket and set it adrift in the Nile River. This divine guidance ensured Musa's protection and survival. The basket drifted to the Pharaoh's palace. (Ibn Kathir)

- **Pharaoh's Wife (Asiyah) and Adoption:** The Pharaoh's wife, Asiyah, upon finding the baby, took pity on him. Despite Pharaoh's initial desire to kill him, Asiyah's love for the child swayed his decision. She pleaded with him to adopt Musa, stating, _"a comfort for me and for you. Do not kill him; perhaps he may benefit us, or we may adopt him as a son."_ [Surah Al-Qasas:9] (Tabari)

- **Musa Returns to His Mother:** Allah ensured that Musa was brought back to his mother. The Quran recounts that when Musa refused to nurse from any woman, his sister suggested a woman who would be a compassionate caregiver, Musa's own mother. Thus, Musa was reunited with his mother, who raised him, and his heart was comforted. (Qurtubi)

**2. Musa's Growing Up and Early Incidents:**

Musa grew up in Pharaoh's palace, unaware of his true identity as an Israelite. He received an education and lived a life of privilege.

- **The Killing of the Egyptian:** One day, Musa witnessed an Egyptian man fighting with an Israelite. Musa intervened to defend the Israelite, and in doing so, accidentally killed the Egyptian. [Surah Al-Qasas:15] _"And he entered the city at a time of inattention by its people and found there two men fighting: one from his faction and one from among his enemies. The one from his faction cried out to him for help against the one from among his enemies, so Moses struck him and [unintentionally] killed him. [Moses] said, "This is from the work of Satan. Indeed, he is a manifest enemy, "..._

- **Escape and Journey to Madyan:** Fearing retribution, Musa fled Egypt and journeyed to Madyan, where he sought refuge. Musa left Egypt out of fear for his own life, as he knew that the Pharaoh would seek to punish him for killing an Egyptian. This incident highlights his compassion for his people and his righteousness. [Surah Al-Qasas:21] _"So he left it, fearful and anticipating, [and] he said, "My Lord, save me from the wrongdoing people."_

- **Musa's Encounter with the Daughters of Shu'ayb (Jethro):** In Madyan, Musa encountered two women tending to their flock. He helped them water their animals, demonstrating kindness and generosity. [Surah Al-Qasas:23-24] _"And when he arrived at the well of Madyan, he found there a crowd of people watering [their flocks], and he found besides them two women driving back [their flocks]. He said, "What is your situation?" They said, "We do not water until the shepherds dispatch [their flocks]; and our father is an old man." So he watered [their flocks] for them. Then he went back to the shade and said, "My Lord, indeed I am, for whatever You would send down to me of good, in need."_ The daughters of Shu'ayb informed their father about Musa's strength and kindness.

- **Marriage to a Daughter of Shu'ayb:** Musa was invited to stay with Shu'ayb. He was offered to marry one of Shu'ayb's daughters. Musa agreed, and he worked for Shu'ayb for a certain period, as a condition of the marriage. [Surah Al-Qasas:26-27] _"One of the women said, "O my father, hire him. Indeed, the best one you can hire is the strong and the trustworthy." He said, "Indeed, I wish to wed you to one of these two daughters of mine, on [the condition] that you serve me for eight years; but if you complete ten, it will be [as a favor] from you. And I do not want to put you in difficulty. You will find me, if Allah wills, of the righteous." He said, "That is [agreed] between me and you. So whichever of the two terms I fulfill - there is no injustice toward me. And Allah is witness over what we say."_ (Ibn Kathir)

**3. The Divine Call and Prophethood:**

- **The Burning Bush and the Divine Revelation:** While journeying back to Egypt with his wife after completing the agreed-upon time with Shu'ayb, Musa stopped near Mount Tur (Sinai). There, he witnessed a fire burning in a bush, but the bush was not consumed. This was a sign of Allah's presence. Allah spoke to Musa and revealed his Prophethood. [Surah Ta-Ha:11-16] _"But when he came to it, he was called, "O Moses, Indeed, I am your Lord, so remove your sandals. Indeed, you are in the sacred valley of Ṭuwā. And I have chosen you, so listen to what is revealed. Indeed, I am Allah. There is no deity except Me, so worship Me and establish prayer for My remembrance. Indeed, the Hour is coming - I almost conceal it - so that every soul may be recompensed according to that for which it strives. So do not let one who does not believe in it and follows his desire divert you from it, lest you perish."_

- **Musa's Fears and Prayers:** Musa felt overwhelmed and uncertain. He expressed fear of the Pharaoh and asked Allah for assistance and support. Musa acknowledged his fear and asked Allah to ease his task. He prayed for the removal of any speech impediment and the empowerment of his brother, Harun (Aaron), to assist him.

- **Musa's Request for Harun:** Musa requested that Harun be appointed as a prophet to support him in his mission. Allah accepted Musa's prayer and appointed Harun as a prophet as well. [Surah Ta-Ha:29-32] _"And grant me a helper from my family - Aaron, my brother. Increase him in my affair and let him share my task, so that we may exalt You much and remember You much. Indeed, You are, of us, ever Seeing."_ (Tabari)

- **The Signs of Prophethood:** Musa was given two signs:
  1.  His staff, which could transform into a serpent.
  2.  His hand, which would radiate a brilliant light when placed under his arm. [Surah An-Naml:10] _"And [then] cast down your staff." But when he saw it writhing as if it were a snake, he turned and fled and did not return. [Allah said], "O Moses, do not fear. Indeed, in My presence the messengers do not fear."_

**4. The Confrontation with Pharaoh:**

Musa and Harun were sent to Pharaoh to convey Allah's message, to free the Israelites from slavery, and to worship the One God.

- **Conveying the Message:** Musa and Harun delivered Allah's message to Pharaoh, but he dismissed them and refused to believe. Pharaoh was arrogant and defiant, claiming divinity for himself. [Surah Ash-Shu'ara:16-19] _"So go, both of you, to Pharaoh and say, 'We are messengers of the Lord of the worlds, That you send with us the Children of Israel.'" [Pharaoh] said, "Did we not raise you among us as a child, and you remained among us for years of your life? And you did your deed which you did, and you were of the ungrateful."_ (Qurtubi)

- **Pharaoh's Response:** Pharaoh responded with disbelief, arrogance, and threats. He challenged Musa to prove his claim. He accused Musa of sorcery and called upon his own magicians to counter Musa's signs.

- **The Showdown with the Magicians:** Pharaoh gathered his most skilled magicians to challenge Musa. The magicians initially performed impressive feats, seemingly overpowering Musa. However, when Musa cast his staff, it transformed into a massive serpent, swallowing all the magicians' creations. [Surah Ash-Shu'ara:44-49] _"So the magicians fell down in prostration [to Allah]. They said, "We have believed in the Lord of the worlds, The Lord of Moses and Aaron." [Pharaoh] said, "Did you believe in him before I gave you permission? Indeed, he is your master who has taught you magic, but you are going to know. I will surely cut off your hands and your feet on opposite sides, and I will surely crucify you all." They said, "No harm. Indeed, to our Lord we will return. Indeed, we hope that our Lord will forgive us our sins because we were the first [to believe] of the believers."_

- **The Magicians' Conversion:** Witnessing the undeniable power of Allah, the magicians realized the truth and immediately accepted Islam. They proclaimed their belief in the Lord of Musa and Harun, defying Pharaoh's authority, and were then threatened by the Pharaoh. (Ibn Kathir)

**5. The Plagues of Egypt:**

When Pharaoh refused to release the Israelites, Allah sent a series of devastating plagues upon Egypt.

- **The Plagues:**

  1.  **Turning of staves into serpents:** This was a sign of the power of Allah, demonstrating that Musa's staff could become a snake.
  2.  **The Plague of the Waters Turning into Blood:** All the water turned into blood, and this was a sign of Allah's punishment for the refusal of the Pharaoh to release the Israelites.
  3.  **The Plague of the Frogs:** Frogs emerged in abundance, invading homes and causing great distress.
  4.  **The Plague of the Lice (or Locusts):** Swarms of lice or locusts infested the land, causing widespread destruction. (Interpretations vary)
  5.  **The Plague of the Frogs** Frogs emerged in abundance, invading homes and causing great distress.
  6.  **The Plague of the Blood** All the water turned into blood, and this was a sign of Allah's punishment for the refusal of the Pharaoh to release the Israelites.
  7.  **The Plague of the Locusts:** locusts ate the crops, causing famine.
  8.  **The Plague of the Lice:** lice attacked the bodies and animals, causing distress and illness. (Interpretations vary)
  9.  **The Plague of the Death** of the livestock: This affected the livestock of the Egyptians.
  10. **The Plague of the Boils:** boils broke out on people's skin.
  11. **The Plague of the Darkness:** The plague was a darkness that persisted for a long time.
  12. **The Plague of the Storm:** This destroyed the buildings and the land.
  13. **The Plague of the Death of the Firstborn:** the firstborn sons of the Egyptians were killed.

- **Pharaoh's Temporary Yielding:** Each time a plague struck, Pharaoh would plead with Musa to remove it, promising to release the Israelites. However, as soon as the plague was lifted, Pharaoh would break his promise.

**6. The Exodus and the Parting of the Sea:**

- **The Final Plague: The Death of the Firstborn:** After enduring the plagues, Allah sent the final, most devastating plague, the death of the firstborn sons of the Egyptians. This event forced Pharaoh to finally concede and allow the Israelites to leave. [Surah Ad-Dukhan:17-20] _"And We had certainly tried before them the people of Pharaoh, and there came to them a noble messenger, [Saying], "Render to me the servants of Allah. Indeed, I am to you a trustworthy messenger. And [do not] be arrogant toward Allah. Indeed, I have come to you with a clear authority."_

- **The Israelites' Flight:** The Israelites, led by Musa, left Egypt in haste, taking with them their belongings.

- **Pharaoh's Pursuit:** Pharaoh, regretting his decision, pursued the Israelites with his army. [Surah Ash-Shu'ara:52-60] _"So We inspired to Moses, "Set out with My servants by night; indeed, you are to be pursued." Then Pharaoh sent among the cities gatherers. [Saying], "Indeed, those are but a small band, And indeed, they are enraging us, And indeed, we are a cautious group." So We removed them from gardens and springs, And treasures and a noble station. Thus. And We caused the Children of Israel to inherit it._

- **The Parting of the Sea:** As the Israelites reached the Red Sea, they were trapped, with Pharaoh's army closing in. Musa, with Allah's guidance, struck the sea with his staff, and the sea miraculously parted, creating a path for the Israelites to cross. [Surah Ash-Shu'ara:63] _"Then We inspired to Moses, "Strike with your staff the sea," and it parted, and each portion was like a great towering mountain."_

- **Pharaoh's Destruction:** The Israelites crossed safely. When Pharaoh and his army followed them into the sea, the water closed in, drowning them. [Surah Yunus:90-92] _"And We took the Children of Israel across the sea, and Pharaoh and his soldiers pursued them in transgression and enmity until, when drowning overtook him, he said, "I believe that there is no deity except that in whom the Children of Israel believe, and I am of the Muslims." [Allah said], "Now? And you have disobeyed [Him] before and were of the corrupters? So today We will save you in body that you may be to those after you a sign. And indeed, many of the people, of Our verses, are heedless."_

**7. The Wilderness and the Giving of the Law:**

- **The Israelites in the Wilderness:** After crossing the sea, the Israelites wandered in the wilderness for a period. They faced hardships, including hunger, thirst, and internal conflicts.

- **The Giving of the Torah:** Musa ascended Mount Sinai and received the Torah, the divine law, from Allah. The Torah contained commandments, laws, and guidance for the Israelites. [Surah Al-A'raf:142] _"And We made an appointment with Moses for thirty nights and completed them with ten [more], and the term of his Lord was completed [i.e., a total] forty nights. And Moses said to Aaron, his brother, "Take my place among my people, do right, and do not follow the way of the corrupters."_ (Ibn Kathir)

- **The Golden Calf:** During Musa's absence on Mount Sinai, some Israelites, led by Samiri, created a golden calf and began to worship it. This act of idolatry was a severe test of their faith.

- **Musa's Return and the Punishment of the Idolaters:** Musa returned to find his people worshipping the golden calf. He was filled with anger and sorrow. He confronted Harun for failing to stop them. Musa then confronted Samiri and punished him, and those who had worshipped the calf were also punished. [Surah Ta-Ha:97] _" [Moses] said, "Then go. And indeed, [for you] in [this] life is [to be] that you say, "No contact." And indeed, you have an appointment [in the Hereafter] you will not fail to keep. And look at your god which you were devoted to. We will surely burn it and blow it into the sea with a blast."_

- **The Forgiveness of Allah:** Despite the transgression, Allah showed mercy and forgave those who repented and sought His forgiveness.

**8. Further Challenges and Musa's Death:**

- **Further Trials:** The Israelites continued to face trials and tribulations, including a lack of faith and a reluctance to enter the Promised Land.

- **The Story of the Cow:** The Quran recounts the story of the Israelites being instructed to sacrifice a cow. [Surah Al-Baqarah:67-73] _"And [recall] when Moses said to his people, "Indeed, Allah commands you to slaughter a cow." They said, "Do you take us in ridicule?" He said, "I seek refuge in Allah that I should be among the ignorant." They said, "Call upon your Lord to show us what it is." He said, "Indeed, [Allah] says, 'It is a cow neither old nor virgin, but [it is] between that.' So do what you are commanded." They said, "Call upon your Lord to show us what is its color." He said, "Indeed, [Allah] says, 'It is a yellow cow, bright in color - pleasing to the observers.'" They said, "Call upon your Lord to show us what it is. Indeed, the cows have become alike to us. And indeed, we, if Allah wills, will be guided." He said, "Indeed, [Allah] says, 'It is a cow not trained to plow the earth or irrigate the field; it is sound; there is no blemish upon it.'" They said, "Now you have come with the truth." So they slaughtered it, but they had not been about to do so."_ This story highlights their resistance to following Allah's commands.

- **The Promised Land:** After many years in the wilderness, Musa led the Israelites to the borders of the Promised Land, but he did not enter it himself. The Quran does not explicitly state the location of his death, but it is understood he died before entering the Promised Land. (Ibn Kathir)

- **Musa's Legacy:** Musa is revered in Islam as a prophet, a messenger, and a righteous servant of Allah. His life and struggle serve as an example of steadfastness, faith, and unwavering commitment to Allah's mission.
